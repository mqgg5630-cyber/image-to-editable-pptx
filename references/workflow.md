# Reconstruction workflow

## 1. Inspect the source

Record page dimensions, background, title block, major horizontal and vertical anchors, repeated modules, and the smallest readable text. Identify whether the source is a clean slide export, screenshot, scan, or photographed page.

## 2. Establish anchors before details

Build the major geometry first: page margins, title baseline, separators, large panels, columns, rows, and primary arrows. Repeated modules should share measured dimensions and spacing.

## 3. Reconstruct text line by line

Use OCR only as a candidate transcription. Compare every visible string with the source. Preserve punctuation, capitalization, Chinese/English spacing, line breaks, and emphasized runs. Prefer one object per source line for short labels.

## 4. Reconstruct simple geometry natively

Use PowerPoint shapes for rectangles, rounded cards, borders, arrows, connectors, and basic geometric symbols. This keeps the slide editable and avoids fuzzy raster edges.

## 5. Isolate complex visuals

Use a cropped/transparent image only when the visual cannot be represented reliably with simple geometry. Ensure the asset does not contain neighboring text, separators, or unrelated structure.

## 6. Compile from PageIR

Validate PageIR first, then compile. Do not silently repair wording or geometry inside the compiler. Put all page-specific decisions in PageIR.

## 7. Render and compare

Render the PPTX to an image and compare it to the source at the same pixel dimensions. Review the full-page difference and local areas around text baselines, thin rules, icon edges, and module boundaries.

## 8. Repair the owning layer

- Wrong wording -> fix text transcription.
- Wrapping or baseline drift -> fix text bbox/font metrics.
- Shape displacement -> fix PageIR geometry.
- Wrong color or stroke -> fix PageIR style.
- Complex visual contamination -> rebuild the asset.
- White background request not satisfied -> set the page background and remove non-semantic screenshot texture.

## 9. Final check

Confirm editable text, native structures, no hidden full-slide screenshot, no overflow, and no unexplained large difference regions. Re-run the validators after the final edit.
